After metadata extracted automatically from digital documents, user can interact and correct them before they are exported to XML files. Developing a tool to extract metadata from digital documents is a very necessary and useful task for building collections, organizing and searching documents in digital libraries. The extraction method is tested on computer science paper collections selected from international journals, proceedings downloaded from digital libraries such as ACM, IEEE, Springer and CiteSeer. -|- IEEE -|- 
2 -|- Extreme Learning Machine with Fuzzy Activation Function -|- Hieu Trung span class='snippet'>Huynh and Yonggwan Won -|- http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/NCM.2009.206 -|- 2009 -|- Recently, an efficient learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) has been proposed for single-hidden layer feed forward neural networks (SLFNs). Unlike the traditional gradient-descent based learning algorithms which determine network weights by iterative processes, the ELM algorithm analytically determines the output weights with random choice of input weights and hidden layer biases. This algorithm can achieve good performance with very high learning speed. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy-based activation function for SLFNs trained by ELM algorithm. This is a simple sigmoid-like nonlinear activation function and more suitable for hardware implementation. The experimental results for real applications show that this activation function offers good performance which is compatible to the sigmoidal activation function. -|- IEEE -|-

N.  -|- http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1063/1.1357459 -|- 2001 -|- In this paper, we present a timing synchronization scheme of the next generation IEEE 802.tin wireless LAN standard which is based on MIMO-OFDM technique. The proposed timing synchronization method takes two steps which consist of two modified auto-correlators. For coarse timing synchronization, a sliding window differentiator is used after a conventional auto-correlation in order to avoid plateau problem. The conjugate symmetry property of L-LTS is used for fine timing synchronization. Since cross-correlation based methods are not required, the computational complexity and the number of multiplier can be reduced. In order to reduce the hardware complexity, we have used sign comparators (SC) instead of using multipliers. Based on simulation results, the proposed method outperforms a conventional method. The proposed scheme can be applied to IEEE 802.1 In systems and can easily be expanded to frequency synchronization scheme. -|- IEEE -|-
